    (X) Switching to workspace concept. Will ask at the start of program.

    (X) Import/Export pspec.xml file.
        (X) Design C++ class to package pspec information.
            (X) Load pisi info to QDomDocument from pspec.xml file by Pisi class.

            (*) Add files and folders to check list in pisi build directory. (/var/pisi/PACKAGE/install/*)
            (*) Operation will force until all files are on check list.
            (*) Design a new dialog for check list operation. With this dialog, any file or folder
                can tagged with a fileType. The datas taken from this dialog will add a table or list.
